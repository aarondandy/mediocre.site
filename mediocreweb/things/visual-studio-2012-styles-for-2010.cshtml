  In recent years I have found myself favoring darker themes for Visual Studio starting with the <a href="http://www.nerdpad.com/visual-studio/visual-studio-2010-dark-expression-blend-color-theme">expression theme</a>.
	Since using the newer Dark theme in Visual Studio 2012 I have found it a bit easier to read while still being easy on the eyes and quite fashionable.
	While that is great I have recently upgraded Visual Studio at work ... to 2010 so I made a theme for it.

<h2>Visual Studio 2012 Dark Theme for 2010</h2>
<p>
  Because I will be using 2010 for a few years probably I took the time to port the 2012 look to 2010.
	I also included coloring for ReSharper too.
	It was a lot of tedious work  but I feel it was worth it as I will spend plenty of hours using the theme.
