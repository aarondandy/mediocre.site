In recent years I have found myself favoring darker themes for Visual Studio starting with the [expression theme](http://www.nerdpad.com/visual-studio/visual-studio-2010-dark-expression-blend-color-theme).
Since using the newer Dark theme in Visual Studio 2012 I have found it a bit easier to read while still being easy on the eyes and quite fashionable.
While that is great I have recently upgraded Visual Studio at work ... to 2010 so I made a theme for it.

## Visual Studio 2012 Dark Theme for 2010

Because I will be using VS 2010 for a few years probably I took the time to port the 2012 look to 2010.
I also included coloring for ReSharper too.
It was a lot of tedious work  but I feel it was worth it as I will spend plenty of hours using the theme.
