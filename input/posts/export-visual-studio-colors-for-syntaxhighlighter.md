For my code snippets posted to a previous website I decided to use [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/).
It was working well enough for me but I was not too fond of the themes that it offered.
They were either too bright or too hard to read.
I use Visual Studio often and figured it would just make sense to use that as a theme so I made a little Visual Studio extension to extract the colors and write them out to a CSS file.
